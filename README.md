# React Real Estate App

This is a **Real Estate Application** built with **React**, which allows users to view, add, update, and delete property listings. The app also includes features like conditional rendering, dynamic mapping of property cards, form validation, and client-side routing for different pages.

## Features

1. **Display Property Listings:**
   - Property details such as title, location, price, and image are displayed in a visually appealing way using reusable React components.

2. **Create, Delete, and Edit Property:**
   - Users can add new properties through a form, delete existing properties, and update property details.

3. **Dynamic Property Cards:**
   - Property listings are dynamically rendered by mapping over an array of property data, allowing for easy scalability.

4. **Form Validation:**
   - Form inputs are validated to ensure proper data entry (e.g., price must be a number, location cannot be empty).

5. **Client-Side Routing:**
   - Different pages like "Property List", "Add Property", "Edit Property", and "Login" are routed using **React Router**. Protected routes are also implemented to restrict access to authenticated users.

6. **Persistence Using Local Storage (Bonus):**
   - The property list is persisted between page reloads using **localStorage**.
